# Fuel Cost Calculator

Small app for learning Haskell which estimates the price of fuel for a given
trip. Supports kilometers and miles per litre for fuel efficiency input via the
`Read` typeclass. Accepts locations in many formats and allows for multi-stop
trip calculations via the [MapQuest](https://developer.mapquest.com/) API.
